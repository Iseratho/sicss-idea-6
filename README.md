## Idea 6: Twitter politicians in country X and their sentiments about public institution under fire 

Description: look at 100 most popular politicians on Twitter from country X, scrape their tweets with specific key-terms relating to the institution under fire (public broadcaster, scientific institution,...). do sentiment analysis/hatespeech detection on the tweets and network analysis (who are they amplifying, who are they quote-tweeting)
For instance, the digital news report 2022 for Belgium saw that trust in the Flemish public broadcaster is very high, but that it is also the most polarised news brand when looking at the political affiliation of respondents.
Can also look at politicians’ discourse on Twitter about the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can also offer an interesting view on who amplifies COVID conspiracies and bring them in the mainstream.

Could do this for several countries’ centres for disease control and compare the timelines of these sentiments with pandemic data (ourworldindata)
