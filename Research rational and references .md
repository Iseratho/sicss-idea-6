Twitter politicians in country UK and their sentiments about public institution under fire 

Twitter is one of the communications media used by politicians for interactions with their audiences. With 290.5 million monthly active users worldwide, the number of Twitter users is expected to continue to grow to over 340 million users by 2024 (Twitter, n.d.). Almost a quarter of the British and nearly half of the Dutch candidates shared their thoughts, visions, and experiences on Twitter (Broersma & Graham, 2012). 
The COVID epidemic is full of challenges, and has been plagued by variations in feelings towards public services. A study of health provision (Ainley et al., 2021) found that the proportion of positive tweets about access to and quality of remote care was higher in the period immediately following the outbreak of COVID-19 (March-May 2020) compared to the period before the outbreak of COVID-19, and to the period when the first lockdown restrictions were lifted (June-October 2020).
Politicians represent a proportion of the population and express their opinions and feelings about public services. Assuming that what they say reflects the population they represent, it is important to be able to analyse their sentiments towards public institutions in fearful situations such as the pandemic period.
